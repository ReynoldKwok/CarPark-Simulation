# CarPark-Simulation
### Project Description
This project simulates a carpark ticketing system. The software asks user to input a vehicle regestration no when entering and exiting the carpark, allocates a free parking space for entering car, records the parking duration and calculates parking fee for exiting car. The software also allows user to query the parking information with their vehicle regestration no.

### Files Description
- `Carpark.py`: The main python file contains codes for all the functions in the carpark ticketing system.

- `cmdUI.py`: This python file creates a command prompt user interface for users to interact with the software.
  
- `GUI.py`: This python file creates a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to interact with the software.

- `Record.csv`: All data is saved into this csv file whenever the software is closed.
